# LargeNum
Java and other languages provide integer types that use a fixed amount of memory, which means the values are limited. For example, a long in Java uses 64 bits, and has a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). But what if you need to use even bigger integers, ones with no upper limit at all? Perhaps we'd like to be able to have numbers like 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 and be able to do addition, etc. with them. This project implements a class that allows positive integers, including 0, and supports construction, conversion to string, comparison, and addition.
